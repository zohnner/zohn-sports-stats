# SportStrata — Decisions Log

Cross-domain decisions that constrain future work. All personas read this at session start before touching ISSUES.md or GOALS.md. Finn records; seniors decide.

**Statuses:** `open` = decision made, not yet actioned | `in-progress` = work underway | `complete` = fully resolved | `superseded` = replaced by a later decision

## D-001 — Design System Overhaul Precedes 2026 Feature Expansion
**Status:** complete
**Contributors:** Kael
**Date opened:** 2026-05-17 | **Date resolved:** 2026-05-17

**Decision needed:**
Whether the 2026 design system overhaul and feature gap closure (spray charts, team leaderboard filter, H2H matchups) happen concurrently or sequentially, and if sequentially, in what order.

**Options considered:**
- Concurrent: build features and overhaul the system in parallel
- Sequential, features first: ship the feature gaps, then clean up the system
- Sequential, overhaul first: complete the design system audit before adding new components

**Decision:**
Overhaul first. New feature components should be built into a resolved system, not onto a partially inconsistent one.

**Rationale:**
Features built before the overhaul will inherit whatever inconsistencies exist today and require a second pass when the system is eventually cleaned up. That's rework. Building into a clean system costs nothing extra and produces components that don't need to be revisited.

**Implications:**
- No new UI components for spray charts, team filter, or H2H matchups should be started until the design system audit in `css/variables.css` and `css/components.css` is complete and signed off by Kael.
- Axiom and Finn should not begin feature implementation on any 2026 gap item until Kael marks the overhaul complete.
- Vera's specs for those features can be written in advance — spec work is not blocked.

## D-002 — P1-006 Is a Launch Prerequisite Superseding All Other Readiness Work
**Status:** open
**Contributors:** Axiom
**Date opened:** 2026-05-17 | **Date resolved:** —

**Decision needed:**
Whether P1-006 (BDL_API_KEY plaintext in `js/api.js:11`) must be resolved before any other launch-readiness work is considered blocking.

**Decision:**
Yes. P1-006 is resolved before any public push, regardless of what else is complete. No other readiness metric (Lighthouse score, WCAG pass, Broadcast Blurb deployment) is relevant until the key is out of source.

**Rationale:**
A live API key in a public repo is an incident. Everything else is polish. The fix is written (`worker/bdl-proxy.js` exists); this is an execution gap, not an engineering problem.

**Implications:**
- Finn must flag immediately if any session involves `js/api.js` and the key is still present.
- No commits that include `js/api.js` in its current state should be pushed.
- Axiom owns the deployment of the BDL worker proxy. No one else executes this step.
- `/deploy-check` must be run before any push and will catch this automatically.

## D-003 — AppState Fetch Deduplication Required Before 2026 Feature Push
**Status:** complete
**Contributors:** Axiom
**Date opened:** 2026-05-17 | **Date resolved:** 2026-05-17

**Decision needed:**
Whether AppState race conditions (multiple views independently fetching the same shared field) should be addressed before or after the 2026 feature push adds more async dependencies.

**Decision:**
Before. Fetch deduplication for shared AppState fields (`mlbLeaderSplits`, `mlbHotStats`, `mlbSavantLeaderboard`) must be in place before new features add more shared async fields to the same pattern.

**Rationale:**
The race condition is latent today. Each new feature that depends on a shared AppState field increases the probability of a double-fetch or stale-render timing bug. Fixing the pattern once before the push is cheaper than debugging it after three more features have been built on top of it.

**Implications:**
- Axiom owns this fix. It is scoped to `mlbFetch()` or a thin pending-promise registry around shared field fetches.
- Finn should not implement any feature that introduces a new shared AppState field until this is resolved.
- The fix must be reviewed by Axiom and confirmed with a smoke test across the leaders, player detail, and game prep views before being marked complete.

## D-004 — WCAG Audit Required Before Pro or Enterprise Tier Launch
**Status:** open
**Contributors:** Kael, Vera
**Date opened:** 2026-05-17 | **Date resolved:** —

**Decision needed:**
Whether a structured WCAG AA accessibility audit is required before any paid tier (Pro or Enterprise) is launched to users.

**Decision:**
Yes. A structured audit — minimum axe-core or Lighthouse accessibility pass — must be completed and findings addressed before any paid tier opens. The audit targets MLB players, leaders, and player detail views first.

**Rationale:**
The current state is "partial" with no audit run. That means the gap is unknown. Selling a Pro tier to broadcast professionals who use keyboard shortcuts and production assistants who may use assistive technology without confirming basic accessibility is not acceptable. The Enterprise plan specifically targets stations and networks where this is a real-world concern.

**Implications:**
- Vera owns the audit scope and reviewing findings. Kael owns color contrast remediation. Axiom owns keyboard navigation and focus management fixes.
- Finn can execute the axe-core / Lighthouse run and document findings in ISSUES.md as individual named entries.
- The WCAG pass is a launch gate for revenue tiers only — it does not block free-tier ongoing development.

## D-005 — Throttled-Network Verification Pass Required Before 2026 Feature Push
**Status:** open
**Contributors:** Kael
**Date opened:** 2026-05-17 | **Date resolved:** —

**Decision needed:**
Whether all views should be manually verified under throttled network conditions before the 2026 feature push adds more async data dependencies.

**Decision:**
Yes. Every MLB view must be walked in Chrome DevTools with network throttled to "Slow 3G" before the feature push begins. The goal is to confirm that skeleton states appear correctly, partial data failures produce graceful error states (not blank containers), and no view silently breaks under a cold cache.

**Rationale:**
Skeleton states exist but coverage has not been verified. Each new feature adds async dependencies. If a skeleton gap exists today, it compounds with every new data dependency added on top of it. Confirming coverage now is cheaper than discovering it after the push.

**Implications:**
- Finn executes the verification pass across all MLB views and documents any gaps in ISSUES.md.
- Vera reviews gaps for UX spec requirements. Axiom reviews gaps for implementation.
- Any view that shows a blank container on partial failure — rather than a skeleton + error message — is a P2 bug before the feature push is approved.

## D-007 — Baseball Scorecard Feature Approved — Phase-Gated Implementation
**Status:** open
**Contributors:** Axiom
**Date opened:** 2026-05-17 | **Date resolved:** —

**Decision needed:**
Whether to proceed with the baseball scorecard feature (as documented in `Documentation/baseball-scorecard-docs.md`), and if so, in what phases and with what constraints.

**Options considered:**
- Full feature set (all 6 phases) approved and implemented sequentially
- Phase-gated: approve Phase 1 only, each subsequent phase requires the previous to ship and be reviewed
- Defer entirely until MLB depth goals are met

**Decision:**
Proceed, phase-gated. Phase 1 (historical static render) is approved in principle. Each subsequent phase requires the previous phase to ship and be reviewed before starting.

**Rationale:**
The feature maps directly to the target audience (broadcasters, statheds), the MLB Stats API play-by-play endpoint is free and already in scope, and the architecture fits the existing vanilla JS/CSS pattern. Phase-gating manages scope risk — the full feature set is 3–4 months of work; Phase 1 alone proves the concept and delivers a genuinely differentiated artifact. Phase 5 (annotation mode, custom notation) is parked indefinitely — insufficient evidence of demand to justify the complexity.

**Implications:**
- Implementation is blocked on D-001 (design system overhaul complete) and D-003 (fetch deduplication). No code written before both close.
- Kael must produce the visual design — grid layout, diamond SVG, new CSS token additions — before Phase 1 starts. New tokens go through the normal Kael → variables.css review process.
- Vera must produce the behavioral spec — all interaction states (active PA, hover, empty, error, mobile) — before Phase 1 starts.
- Axiom owns: Phase 0 API verification, the html2canvas spike in Phase 4, AppState field additions in Phase 3, and review of all Finn output before any phase is marked complete.
- D3.js is not approved for use in any phase. Diamond animations are vanilla CSS/SVG.
- html2canvas and jsPDF are not approved until the Phase 4 spike assesses viability on the actual rendered scorecard. If html2canvas fails, Axiom escalates the alternative (Cloudflare Worker + headless screenshot) to the project owner before any Phase 4 work proceeds.
- Phase 5 (annotation mode, custom notation) is parked — no spec, no implementation until Phases 1–4 ship and adoption is validated.
- Full per-phase task breakdown lives in ISSUES.md under "Scorecard Feature — Phased Implementation Roadmap."

## D-006 — Broadcast Blurb Worker Deployment Requires Explicit Authorization
**Status:** open
**Contributors:** Axiom
**Date opened:** 2026-05-17 | **Date resolved:** —

**Decision needed:**
Whether the Broadcast Blurb Cloudflare Worker (`worker/wrangler-blurb.toml`, P2-005) should be deployed, and who authorizes the deployment.

**Decision:**
Deployment requires explicit authorization from the project owner. Axiom owns the technical deployment when authorized. No other persona executes this step.

**Rationale:**
The worker calls the Anthropic API, which has real cost implications. The `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` must be set as a secret before deployment. No blocker has been documented in ISSUES.md explaining why this hasn't shipped — if there is a reason (cost concern, rate limit, key not available), it must be documented before this decision can be marked complete.

**Implications:**
- Finn documents any new information about this blocker in ISSUES.md but does not attempt deployment.
- Axiom executes the two deployment commands when authorized: `wrangler secret put ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` + `wrangler deploy`.
- Until deployed, the F1 AI Stat Narratives feature (GOALS.md) is inert in production regardless of how it's described in the goals document.
